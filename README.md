### Goals

-   Complete the Python for Everybody Specialization

### Boundaries / Scope

-   Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
-   Complete Course 2 Python Data Structures

### Success criteria

-   My own application for data retrieval and processing.
-   Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.

### Constraints

-   I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification.

### Assumptions

-   The courses will be available for the duration of the semester.
-   I have all required software.
-   I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.

### Stakeholders

-   Professor - for grade
-   Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud
-   Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job

# What I learned each section

### Week 1: Chapter 1- Why we Program
A program is a sequence of stored instructions. The computer then executes each of those instructions. A computer is not intelligent and just does as instructed. The programmers are the intelligence that figures out the steps to do whatever task is at hand. The human mind will often compensate for errors and use context clues to figure out what is meant, but computers do not do so unless specifically coded to handle errors.

### Week 2: Chapter 2- Variable and Expressions
Certain words are reserved in programing languages and cannot be used as variable names (in python some reserved words are input, for, if, while, and there are many more). Programing text editors, like PyCharm, make it much easier to write code than doing it in a shell because when you write in a shell every you have to enter each line perfectly at the same time for it to work. In text editor you can go back and correct your mistakes without having to retype everything. The lines of code in the text editor are often referred to as scripts.

There are 4 patterns of code. 1. Sequential: just going step by step down the code. 2. Conditional: Similar to sequential but there are conditions for some steps to happen ( IF this THEN that). 3. Repeating: This is where computers become very powerful, It is when the program can repeat steps as many times as needed. 4. Store and Retrieve: Will be covered in chapter 4.
