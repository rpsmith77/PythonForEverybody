# What I learned each section

### Week 1: Chapter 1- Why we Program
A program is a sequence of stored instructions. The computer then executes each of those instructions. A computer is not intelligent and just does as instructed. The programmers are the intelligence that figures out the steps to do whatever task is at hand. The human mind will often compensate for errors and use context clues to figure out what is meant, but computers do not do so unless specifically coded to handle errors.

### Week 2: Chapter 2- Variable and Expressions
Certain words are reserved in programing languages and cannot be used as variable names (in python some reserved words are input, for, if, while, and there are many more). Programing text editors, like PyCharm, make it much easier to write code than doing it in a shell because when you write in a shell every you have to enter each line perfectly at the same time for it to work. In text editor you can go back and correct your mistakes without having to retype everything. The lines of code in the text editor are often referred to as scripts.

There are 4 patterns of code. 1. Sequential: just going step by step down the code. 2. Conditional: Similar to sequential but there are conditions for some steps to happen ( IF this THEN that). 3. Repeating: This is where computers become very powerful, It is when the program can repeat steps as many times as needed. 4. Store and Retrieve: Will be covered in chapter 4. <br/>

### Week 3: Chapter 3 - Conditional Code 
If statements are essentially saying if this is true then do that, if not go to next step until there are no options left. else is the default case if none of the ifs or else if's are true. else if's and else's aren't always needed but can be extremely useful.
In Python, proper spacing and indentation is critical. Proper spacing and indentation will tell the computer what part of the program each line of code belongs in. Try: and Except: can be used when you know there is a possibility of an error and can stop errors from occurring. It is useful for ensuring proper input.

[Exercise 3](https://github.com/rpsmith77/PythonForEverybody/blob/master/CH3_Exercise3.py).

### Week 4: Chapter 5 - Loops and Iterations
A while loop is similar to an if statement but at the end of the code for the loop it will keep looping until the condition is false. An iteration variable is vital, without it the loop would run indefinitely. code 'break' will exit the loop. code 'continue' will immediately start the next iteration of the loop. When you have a definite loop you can use a for loop.

[Exercise 2](https://github.com/rpsmith77/PythonForEverybody/blob/master/CH5_Exercise2.py).

### Week 5: Chapter 4 - Functions
Calling Back to week 2 this chapter is about the fourth type of patterns in code, store and re-use (A.K.A. functions). Functions are powerful and prevent you from doing redundant lines of codes. Functions are similar to variables but they hold code. Things like print and float are functions already built into python. 
def function(foo): foo is called an alias
function(bar)  bar is a parameter
return stops the function and returns the residual

#### The exercises for this section started with #4

Exercise 4:What is the purpose of the “def” keyword in Python?
 - [ ] a) It is slang that means “the following code is really cool”
 - [ ] b) It indicates the start of a function
 - [ ] c) It indicates that the following indented section of code is to
       be stored for later
 - [x] d) b and c are both true
 
Exercise 5: What will the following Python program print out?<br/>
    def fred():
	    print("Zap") 
    def jane(): 
	    print("ABC")
    jane() 
    fred() 
    jane()
 - [ ] a) Zap ABC jane fred jane
 - [ ] b) Zap ABC Zap
 - [ ] c) ABC Zap jane
 - [x] d) ABC Zap ABC
 - [ ] e) Zap Zap Zap

[Exercise 7](https://github.com/rpsmith77/PythonForEverybody/blob/master/CH4_Exercise%207.py).

### Week 6: Chapter 7- Files
Python interacting with files is extremely powerful and can be used for larger applications. Don't forget about '\n'. Lines end with that and can create funky looking outputs. <br/>
