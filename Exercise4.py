# Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
width = 17
height = 12.0
# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the
# type (of the value of the expression).
# 1. width//2
# 2. width/2.0
# 3. height/3
# 4. 1 + 2 * 5
# Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.
print(width // 2)
print(width / 2.0)
print(height / 3)
print(1 + 2 * 5)
